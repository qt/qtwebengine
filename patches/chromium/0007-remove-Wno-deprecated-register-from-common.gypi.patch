Subject: remove -Wno-deprecated-register from common.gypi.

This warning is not supported by recent clang versions
shipping with XCode. Therefore replacing it with -Wno-deprecated.
This is a bit a too broad fix, but the best we can do for now.
It seems that the flag is still supported in upstream clang.
