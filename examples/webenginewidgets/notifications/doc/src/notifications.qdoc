    \brief Demonstrates how to pass HTML5 web notifications to users.

    \e {\WebEngine Notifications} demonstrates how to use the
    \l QWebEngineProfile::setNotificationPresenter() method and
    \l QWebEngineNotification class to show an HTML5 web
    notification to the user.

    \include examples-run.qdocinc

    \section1 HTML Page

    In this example, we create an internal HTML page that is added through
    a resource collection file (.qrc). The page displays buttons for requesting
    permissions and contains necessary JavaScript code to trigger this request:

    \quotefromfile webenginewidgets/notifications/data/index.html
    \skipto Notification.requestPermission
    \printline requestPermission
    \skipuntil resetPermission
    \printuntil /\}\)$/

    Also page contains a button for creating a notification. The following
    JavaScript constructions are executed on the press event:

    \quotefromfile webenginewidgets/notifications/data/index.html
    \skipto createNotification()
    \printuntil new Notification
    \skipuntil Notification was created
    \printline }

    \section1 Main Function

    In the \c main function, we instantiate a QWebEngineView, load our internal
    HTML page, and set up the required callbacks for notifications handling.

    \section2 Requesting Feature Permissions

    We then use the \l QWebEnginePage::featurePermissionRequested() call to
    request the user's permission to show notifications on their device.

    \quotefromfile webenginewidgets/notifications/main.cpp
    \skipto featurePermissionRequested
    \printuntil });

    \section2 Handling New Notifications

    We then construct a \c NotificationPopup that encapsulates
    the data of the HTML web notification. We also use the
    \l QWebEngineProfile::setNotificationPresenter() call to set
    our handler, which we use in conjunction with our \c popup
    to handle all new notifications.

    \skipto popup
    \printuntil });

    \section1 Presenting Notifications to Users

    The \c NotificationPopup class in this example is a simple
    QWidget-based class that uses multiple QLabel instances
    for displaying the notification's title, message, and icon.

    \quotefromfile webenginewidgets/notifications/notificationpopup.h
    \skipto class NotificationPopup
    \printto public:

    \section2 Presenting Notifications

    Inside the \c present method, we first close and release the previous
    notification if we have one and then take ownership of a new notification
    by calling the \c std::unique_ptr::swap method on our internal notification
    instance.

    \skipto present
    \printto m_title

    Then we query the notification instance for a title, a message,
    and an icon by calling \l QWebEngineNotification::title(),
    \l QWebEngineNotification::message(), \l QWebEngineNotification::icon()
    and set up the appropriate labels in our popup.

    \printuntil m_icon

    After that we are ready to display our notification to the user
    by calling the \l QWidget::show() method. On this step we also call the
    \l QWebEngineNotification::show() method to notify \c JavaScript code
    about our \e show event.

    \printuntil notification->show

    Finally, we set up a callback to handle the \e close event from the
    \c JavaScript side by connecting to the \l QWebEngineNotification::closed()
    signal. We also schedule a timer event to close our active notification
    automatically.

    \skipto QWebEngineNotification::closed
    \printuntil QTimer
    \skipto /\}/
    \printline /\}/

    \section2 Closing Active Notification

    We execute the \e close step for the currently active notification either by
    timeout or by handling the \c JavaScript event. First, we hide the popup
    widget itself by calling \l QWidget::hide(). Then, we notify the \c JavaScript
    code by calling the \l QWebEngineNotification::close() method. Finally, we
    destroy the notification object through the \c std::unique_ptr::reset() method.

    \skipto onClosed
    \printuntil }

    \section2 Implementing User Interaction

    To implement the \e click step for a notification, we handle mouse interaction
    through \l QWidget::mouseReleaseEvent(). On this event, the \c JavaScript code
    is notified by calling the \l QWebEngineNotification::click() method.
    Then we automatically perform the \e close step as a notification is
    considered fully handled and no longer needed, and therefore can be destroyed.

    \skipto mouseReleaseEvent
    \printuntil onClosed
    \printline /\}$/
    \printline /\}$/
