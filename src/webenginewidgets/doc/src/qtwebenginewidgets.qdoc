    \brief The Qt WebEngine Widgets module provides a web browser engine as well as
    C++ classes to render and interact with web content.

    Qt WebEngine Widgets provides a Web browser engine that makes it easy to embed
    content from the World Wide Web into your Qt application.

    Qt WebEngine Widgets provides facilities for rendering of HyperText Markup
    Language (HTML), Extensible HyperText Markup Language (XHTML) and Scalable
    Vector Graphics (SVG) documents, styled using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
    and scripted with JavaScript.

    In addition to providing pure rendering features, HTML documents can be
    made fully editable to the user through the use of the \c{contenteditable}
    attribute on HTML elements.

    Qt WebEngine is based on the Chromium project. More information about
    Chromium itself can be found on the \l{http://www.chromium.org}
    {Chromium Project} Web site.

    \section1 Including In Your Project

    To include the definitions of the module's classes, use the
    following directive:

    \snippet snippets/qtwebengine_build_snippet.qdoc 1

    To link against the module, add this line to your \l qmake \c
    .pro file:

    \snippet snippets/qtwebengine_build_snippet.qdoc 0

    \section1 Notes

    \note Web site icons, also known as "FavIcons", are currently not supported
    on Windows. We plan to address this in a future release.

    \section1 Architecture

    Before an application can use the Qt WebEngine Widgets classes, it must call
    the static initialization method for the module.

    \snippet snippets/simple/main.cpp Initializing QWebEngineWidgets

    The easiest way to render content is through the QWebEngineView class. As a
    widget it can be embedded into your forms or a graphics view, and it
    provides convenience functions for downloading and rendering web sites.

    \snippet snippets/simple/main.cpp Using QWebEngineView

    QWebEngineView is used to view Web pages. An instance of QWebEngineView has one
    QWebEnginePage. QWebEnginePage provides access to the document structure in a page,
    describing features such as frames, the navigation history, and the
    undo/redo stack for editable content.

    Common web browser features, defaults and other settings can be configured
    through the QWebEngineSettings class. It is possible to provide defaults for all
    QWebEnginePage instances through the default settings. Individual attributes
    can be overridden by the page specific settings object.

    \section1 Netscape Plugin Support

    \note Netscape plugin support is only available on desktop platforms.

    Since WebEngine supports the Netscape Plugin API, Qt applications can display
    Web pages that embed common plugins on platforms for which those plugins
    are available. To enable plugin support, the user must have the appropriate
    binary files for those plugins installed and the \l{QWebEngineSettings::PluginsEnabled}
    attribute must be enabled for the application.

    The following locations are searched for plugins:

    \table
    \header \li Linux/Unix (X11)
    \row \li
    \list
    \li \c{.mozilla/plugins} in the user's home directory
    \li \c{.netscape/plugins} in the user's home directory
    \li System locations, such as
    \list
    \li \c{/usr/lib/browser/plugins}
    \li \c{/usr/local/lib/mozilla/plugins}
    \li \c{/usr/lib/firefox/plugins}
    \li \c{/usr/lib64/browser-plugins}
    \li \c{/usr/lib/browser-plugins}
    \li \c{/usr/lib/mozilla/plugins}
    \li \c{/usr/local/netscape/plugins}
    \li \c{/opt/mozilla/plugins}
    \li \c{/opt/mozilla/lib/plugins}
    \li \c{/opt/netscape/plugins}
    \li \c{/opt/netscape/communicator/plugins}
    \li \c{/usr/lib/netscape/plugins}
    \li \c{/usr/lib/netscape/plugins-libc5}
    \li \c{/usr/lib/netscape/plugins-libc6}
    \li \c{/usr/lib64/netscape/plugins}
    \li \c{/usr/lib64/mozilla/plugins}
    \endlist
    \li Locations specified by environment variables:
    \list
    \li \c{$MOZILLA_HOME/plugins}
    \li \c{$MOZ_PLUGIN_PATH}
    \li \c{$QTWEBKIT_PLUGIN_PATH}
    \endlist
    \endlist
    \endtable

    \table
    \header  \li Windows
    \row \li
    \list
    \li The user's \c{Application Data\Mozilla\plugins} directory
    \li Standard system locations of plugins for Quicktime, Flash, etc.
    \endlist
    \endtable

    \table
    \header \li Mac OS X
    \row \li
    \list
    \li \c{Library/Internet Plug-Ins} in the user's home directory
    \li The system \c{/Library/Internet Plug-Ins} directory
    \endlist
    \endtable

    \section1 Examples

    There are several Qt WebEngine Widgets examples located in the
    \l{Qt WebEngine Widgets Examples} page.

    \section1 License Information
    //FIXME: check if we are allowed to use the name chromium here or if it is considered promotional use.

    \brief Examples demonstrating the Qt WebEngine Widgets usage
    \ingroup all-examples

    Qt provides an integrated Web browser component based on Chromium, the popular
    open source browser engine.

    These examples and demonstrations show a range of different uses for Qt WebEngine,
    from displaying Web pages within a Qt user interface to an implementation of
    a basic function Web browser.
