    \class QWebHistoryInterface
    \since 4.4
    \brief The QWebHistoryInterface class provides an interface to implement link history.

    \inmodule QtWebKit

    The QWebHistoryInterface is an interface that can be used to
    keep track of visited links. It contains two pure virtual methods that
    are called by the WebKit engine: addHistoryEntry() is used to add
    urls that have been visited to the interface, while
    historyContains() is used to query whether the given url has been
    visited by the user. By default the QWebHistoryInterface is not set, so WebKit does not keep
    track of visited links.

    \note The history tracked by QWebHistoryInterface is not specific to an instance of QWebPage
    but applies to all pages.
*/

/*!
    \fn void QWebHistoryInterface::setDefaultInterface(QWebHistoryInterface* defaultInterface)
    Sets a new default interface, \a defaultInterface, that will be used by all of WebKit
    to keep track of visited links.

    If an interface without a parent has already been set, the old interface will be deleted.
    When the application exists QWebHistoryInterface will automatically delete the
    \a defaultInterface if it does not have a parent.
*/

/*!
    \fn QWebHistoryInterface* QWebHistoryInterface::defaultInterface()
    Returns the default interface that will be used by WebKit. If no default interface has been set,
    WebKit will not keep track of visited links and a null pointer will be returned.
    \sa setDefaultInterface()
*/

/*!
    \fn QWebHistoryInterface::QWebHistoryInterface(QObject* parent)
    Constructs a new QWebHistoryInterface with parent \a parent.
*/

/*!
    \fn QWebHistoryInterface::~QWebHistoryInterface()
    Destroys the interface.  If this is currently the default interface it will be unset.
*/

/*!
    \fn bool QWebHistoryInterface::historyContains(const QString &url) const = 0

    Called by the WebKit engine to query whether a certain \a url has been visited by the user already.
    Returns true if the \a url is part of the history of visited links; otherwise returns false.
*/

/*!
    \fn void QWebHistoryInterface::addHistoryEntry(const QString &url) = 0

    Called by WebKit to add another \a url to the list of visited pages.
