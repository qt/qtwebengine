    \class QWebPage
    \since 4.4
    \brief The QWebPage class provides an object to view and edit web documents.

    \inmodule QtWebKit

    QWebPage holds a main frame responsible for web content, settings, the history
    of navigated links and actions. This class can be used, together with QWebFrame,
    to provide functionality like QWebView in a widget-less environment.

    QWebPage's API is very similar to QWebView, as you are still provided with
    common functions like action() (known as
    \l{QWebView::pageAction()}{pageAction}() in QWebView), triggerAction(),
    findText() and settings(). More QWebView-like functions can be found in the
    main frame of QWebPage, obtained via the mainFrame() function. For example,
    the \l{QWebFrame::load()}{load}(), \l{QWebFrame::setUrl()}{setUrl}() and
    \l{QWebFrame::setHtml()}{setHtml}() functions for QWebPage can be accessed
    using QWebFrame.

    The loadStarted() signal is emitted when the page begins to load.The
    loadProgress() signal, on the other hand, is emitted whenever an element
    of the web page completes loading, such as an embedded image, a script,
    etc. Finally, the loadFinished() signal is emitted when the page contents
    are loaded completely, independent of script execution or page rendering.
    Its argument, either true or false, indicates whether or not the load
    operation succeeded.

    \section1 Using QWebPage in a Widget-less Environment

    Before you begin painting a QWebPage object, you need to set the size of
    the viewport by calling setViewportSize(). Then, you invoke the main
    frame's render function (QWebFrame::render()). An example of this
    is shown in the code snippet below.

    Suppose we have a \c Thumbnail class as follows:

    \snippet webkitsnippets/webpage/main.cpp 0

    The \c Thumbnail's constructor takes in a \a url. We connect our QWebPage
    object's \l{QWebPage::}{loadFinished()} signal to our private slot,
    \c render().

    \snippet webkitsnippets/webpage/main.cpp 1

    The \c render() function shows how we can paint a thumbnail using a
    QWebPage object.

    \snippet webkitsnippets/webpage/main.cpp 2

    We begin by setting the \l{QWebPage::viewportSize()}{viewportSize} and
    then we instantiate a QImage object, \c image, with the same size as our
    \l{QWebPage::viewportSize()}{viewportSize}. This image is then sent
    as a parameter to \c painter. Next, we render the contents of the main
    frame and its subframes into \c painter. Finally, we save the scaled image.

    \fn QWebPage::ViewportAttributes QWebPage::viewportAttributesForSize(const QSize& availableSize) const
    Computes the optimal viewport configuration given the \a availableSize, when

    The configuration is also dependent on the device screen size which is obtained
    automatically. For testing purposes the size can be overridden by setting two
    environment variables QTWEBKIT_DEVICE_WIDTH and QTWEBKIT_DEVICE_HEIGHT, which
    both needs to be set.

    The ViewportAttributes includes a pixel density ratio, which will also be exposed to
    the web author though the -webkit-pixel-ratio media feature. This is the ratio
    between 1 density-independent pixel (DPI) and physical pixels.

    A density-independent pixel is equivalent to one physical pixel on a 160 DPI screen,
    so on our platform assumes that as the baseline density.

    The conversion of DIP units to screen pixels is quite simple:

    pixels = DIPs * (density / 160).

    Thus, on a 240 DPI screen, 1 DIPs would equal 1.5 physical pixels.

    An invalid instance will be returned in the case an empty size is passed to the
    method.

    \note The density is automatically obtained from the DPI of the screen where the page
    is being shown, but as many X11 servers are reporting wrong DPI, it is possible to
    override it using QX11Info::setAppDpiY().

    \class QWebFrame
    \since 4.4
    \brief The QWebFrame class represents a frame in a web page.

    \inmodule QtWebKit

    QWebFrame represents a frame inside a web page. Each QWebPage
    object contains at least one frame, the main frame, obtained using
    QWebPage::mainFrame(). Additional frames will be created for HTML
    \c{<frame>} or \c{<iframe>} elements.

    A frame can be loaded using load() or setUrl(). Alternatively, if you have
    the HTML content readily available, you can use setHtml() instead.

    The page() function returns a pointer to the web page object. See
    \l{QWebView}{Elements of QWebView} for an explanation of how web
    frames are related to a web page and web view.

    The QWebFrame class also offers methods to retrieve both the URL currently
    loaded by the frame (see url()) as well as the URL originally requested
    to be loaded (see requestedUrl()). These methods make possible the retrieval
    of the URL before and after a DNS resolution or a redirection occurs during
    the load process. The requestedUrl() also matches to the URL added to the
    frame history (\l{QWebHistory}) if load is successful.

    The title of an HTML frame can be accessed with the title() property.
    Additionally, a frame may also specify an icon, which can be accessed
    using the icon() property. If the title or the icon changes, the
    corresponding titleChanged() and iconChanged() signals will be emitted.
    The zoomFactor() property can be used to change the overall size
    of the content displayed in the frame.

    QWebFrame objects are created and controlled by the web page. You
    can connect to the web page's \l{QWebPage::}{frameCreated()} signal
    to be notified when a new frame is created.

    There are multiple ways to programmatically examine the contents of a frame.
    The hitTestContent() function can be used to find elements by coordinate.
    For access to the underlying DOM tree, there is documentElement(),
    findAllElements() and findFirstElement().

    A QWebFrame can be printed onto a QPrinter using the print() function.
    This function is marked as a slot and can be conveniently connected to
    \l{QPrintPreviewDialog}'s \l{QPrintPreviewDialog::}{paintRequested()}
    signal.

    \fn void QWebFrame::setHtml(const QString &html, const QUrl &baseUrl)
    Sets the content of this frame to \a html. \a baseUrl is optional and used to resolve relative
    URLs in the document, such as referenced images or stylesheets.

    The \a html is loaded immediately; external objects are loaded asynchronously.

    If a script in the \a html runs longer than the default script timeout (currently 10 seconds),
    for example due to being blocked by a modal JavaScript alert dialog, this method will return
    as soon as possible after the timeout and any subsequent \a html will be loaded asynchronously.

    When using this method WebKit assumes that external resources such as JavaScript programs or style
    sheets are encoded in UTF-8 unless otherwise specified. For example, the encoding of an external
    script can be specified through the charset attribute of the HTML script tag. It is also possible
    for the encoding to be specified by web server.

    This is a convenience function equivalent to setContent(html, "text/html", baseUrl).

    \note This method will not affect session or global history for the frame.

    \warning This function works only for HTML, for other mime types (i.e. XHTML, SVG)
    setContent() should be used instead.
