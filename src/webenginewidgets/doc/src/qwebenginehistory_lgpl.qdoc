    Each QWebEngineHistoryItem instance represents an entry in the history stack of a Web page,
    containing information about the page, its location, and when it was last visited.

    The following table shows the properties of the page held by the history item, and
    the functions used to access them.

    \class QWebEngineHistory
    \brief The QWebEngineHistory class represents the history of a QWebEnginePage

    \inmodule QtWebEngine

    Each QWebEnginePage instance contains a history of visited pages that can be accessed
    by QWebEnginePage::history(). QWebEngineHistory represents this history and makes it possible
    to navigate it.

    The history uses the concept of a \e{current item}, dividing the pages visited
    into those that can be visited by navigating \e back and \e forward using the
    back() and forward() functions. The current item can be obtained by calling
    currentItem(), and an arbitrary item in the history can be made the current
    item by passing it to goToItem().

    A list of items describing the pages that can be visited by going back can be
    obtained by calling the backItems() function; similarly, items describing the
    pages ahead of the current page can be obtained with the forwardItems() function.
    The total list of items is obtained with the items() function.

    Just as with containers, functions are available to examine the history in terms
    of a list. Arbitrary items in the history can be obtained with itemAt(), the total
    number of items is given by count(), and the history can be cleared with the
    clear() function.

    QWebEngineHistory's state can be saved to a QDataStream using the >> operator and loaded
    by using the << operator.
