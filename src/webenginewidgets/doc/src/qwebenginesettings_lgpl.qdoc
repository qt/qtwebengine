    \class QWebSettings
    \since 4.4
    \brief The QWebSettings class provides an object to store the settings used
    by QWebPage and QWebFrame.

    \inmodule QtWebKit

    Each QWebPage object has its own QWebSettings object, which configures the
    settings for that page. If a setting is not configured, then it is looked
    up in the global settings object, which can be accessed using
    globalSettings().

    QWebSettings allows configuration of browser properties, such as font sizes and
    families, the location of a custom style sheet, and generic attributes like
    JavaScript and plugins. Individual attributes are set using the setAttribute()
    function. The \l{QWebSettings::WebAttribute}{WebAttribute} enum further describes
    each attribute.

    QWebSettings also configures global properties such as the web page memory
    cache, icon database, local database storage and offline
    applications storage.

    \section1 Enabling Plugins

    Support for browser plugins can enabled by setting the
    \l{QWebSettings::PluginsEnabled}{PluginsEnabled} attribute. For many applications,
    this attribute is enabled for all pages by setting it on the
    \l{globalSettings()}{global settings object}. Qt WebKit will always ignore this setting
    when processing Qt plugins. The decision to allow a Qt plugin is made by the client
    in its reimplementation of QWebPage::createPlugin().

    \section1 Web Application Support

    WebKit provides support for features specified in \l{HTML 5} that improve the
    performance and capabilities of Web applications. These include client-side
    (offline) storage and the use of a Web application cache.

    Client-side (offline) storage is an improvement over the use of cookies to
    store persistent data in Web applications. Applications can configure and
    enable the use of an offline storage database by calling the
    setOfflineStoragePath() with an appropriate file path, and can limit the quota
    for each application by calling setOfflineStorageDefaultQuota().

    \sa QWebPage::settings(), QWebView::settings(), {Web Browser}

/*!
    \fn QWebSettings* QWebSettings::globalSettings()
    Returns the global settings object.

    Any setting changed on the default object is automatically applied to all
    QWebPage instances where the particular setting is not overridden already.

    This enum describes the font sizes configurable through QWebSettings.

    \value MinimumFontSize The hard minimum font size.
    \value MinimumLogicalFontSize The minimum logical font size that is applied
        when zooming out with QWebFrame::setTextSizeMultiplier().
    \value DefaultFontSize The default font size for regular text.
    \value DefaultFixedFontSize The default font size for fixed-pitch text.
*/

/*!
    \enum QWebSettings::ThirdPartyCookiePolicy

    This enum describes the policies configurable for accepting and sending
    third-party cookies. These are cookies that are set or retrieved when fetching
    a resource that is stored for a different registry-controlled domain from the page containing it.

    \value AlwaysAllowThirdPartyCookies Allow third-party resources to set and retrieve cookies.
    \value AlwaysBlockThirdPartyCookies Never allow third-party resources to set and retrieve cookies.
    \value AllowThirdPartyWithExistingCookies If the cookie jar already contains cookies
        from a third-party, allow it to set and retrieve new and existing cookies.

/*!
    \enum QWebSettings::WebGraphic

    This enums describes the standard graphical elements used in webpages.

    \value MissingImageGraphic The replacement graphic shown when an image could not be loaded.
    \value MissingPluginGraphic The replacement graphic shown when a plugin could not be loaded.
    \value DefaultFrameIconGraphic The default icon for QWebFrame::icon().
    \value TextAreaSizeGripCornerGraphic The graphic shown for the size grip of text areas.
    \value DeleteButtonGraphic The graphic shown for the WebKit-Editing-Delete-Button in Deletion UI.

    \value SearchCancelButtonGraphic The graphic shown for clearing the text in a search field.
    \value SearchCancelButtonPressedGraphic The graphic shown when SearchCancelButtonGraphic is pressed.
*/

/*!
    \enum QWebSettings::WebAttribute

    This enum describes various attributes that are configurable through QWebSettings.

    \value AutoLoadImages Specifies whether images are automatically loaded in
        web pages. This is enabled by default.
    \value DnsPrefetchEnabled Specifies whether Qt WebKit will try to pre-fetch DNS entries to
        speed up browsing. This only works as a global attribute. Only for Qt 4.6 and later. This is disabled by default.
    \value JavascriptEnabled Enables or disables the running of JavaScript
        programs. This is enabled by default
    \value JavaEnabled Enables or disables Java applets.
        Currently Java applets are not supported.
    \value PluginsEnabled Enables or disables plugins in Web pages (e.g. using NPAPI). Qt plugins
        with a mimetype such as "application/x-qt-plugin" are not affected by this setting. This is disabled by default.
    \value PrivateBrowsingEnabled Private browsing prevents WebKit from
        recording visited pages in the history and storing web page icons. This is disabled by default.
    \value JavascriptCanOpenWindows Specifies whether JavaScript programs
        can open new windows. This is disabled by default.
    \value JavascriptCanCloseWindows Specifies whether JavaScript programs
        can close windows. This is disabled by default.
    \value JavascriptCanAccessClipboard Specifies whether JavaScript programs
        can read or write to the clipboard. This is disabled by default.
    \value DeveloperExtrasEnabled Enables extra tools for Web developers.
        Currently this enables the "Inspect" element in the context menu as
        well as the use of QWebInspector which controls the web inspector
        for web site debugging. This is disabled by default.
    \value SpatialNavigationEnabled Enables or disables the Spatial Navigation
        feature, which consists in the ability to navigate between focusable
        elements in a Web page, such as hyperlinks and form controls, by using
        Left, Right, Up and Down arrow keys. For example, if a user presses the
        Right key, heuristics determine whether there is an element he might be
        trying to reach towards the right and which element he probably wants.
        This is disabled by default.
    \value LinksIncludedInFocusChain Specifies whether hyperlinks should be
        included in the keyboard focus chain. This is enabled by default.
    \value ZoomTextOnly Specifies whether the zoom factor on a frame applies
        only to the text or to all content. This is disabled by default.
    \value PrintElementBackgrounds Specifies whether the background color and images
        are also drawn when the page is printed. This is enabled by default.
    \value OfflineStorageDatabaseEnabled Specifies whether support for the HTML 5
        offline storage feature is enabled or not. This is disabled by default.
    \value OfflineWebApplicationCacheEnabled Specifies whether support for the HTML 5
        web application cache feature is enabled or not. This is disabled by default.
    \value LocalStorageEnabled Specifies whether support for the HTML 5
        local storage feature is enabled or not. This is disabled by default.
        (This value was introduced in 4.6.)
    \value LocalStorageDatabaseEnabled \e{This enum value is deprecated.} Use
        QWebSettings::LocalStorageEnabled instead.
    \value LocalContentCanAccessRemoteUrls Specifies whether locally loaded documents are
        allowed to access remote urls. This is disabled by default. For more information
        about security origins and local vs. remote content see QWebSecurityOrigin.
        (This value was introduced in 4.6.)
    \value LocalContentCanAccessFileUrls Specifies whether locally loaded documents are
        allowed to access other local urls. This is enabled by default. For more information
        about security origins and local vs. remote content see QWebSecurityOrigin.
    \value XSSAuditingEnabled Specifies whether load requests should be monitored for cross-site
        scripting attempts. Suspicious scripts will be blocked and reported in the inspector's
        JavaScript console. Enabling this feature might have an impact on performance
        and it is disabled by default.
    \value AcceleratedCompositingEnabled This feature, when used in conjunction with
        QGraphicsWebView, accelerates animations of web content. CSS animations of the transform and
        opacity properties will be rendered by composing the cached content of the animated elements.
        This is enabled by default.
    \value TiledBackingStoreEnabled This setting enables the tiled backing store feature
        for a QGraphicsWebView. With the tiled backing store enabled, the web page contents in and around
        the current visible area is speculatively cached to bitmap tiles. The tiles are automatically kept
        in sync with the web page as it changes. Enabling tiling can significantly speed up painting heavy
        operations like scrolling. Enabling the feature increases memory consumption. It does not work well
        with contents using CSS fixed positioning (see also \l{QGraphicsWebView::}{resizesToContents} property).
        \l{QGraphicsWebView::}{tiledBackingStoreFrozen} property allows application to temporarily
        freeze the contents of the backing store. This is disabled by default.
    \value FrameFlatteningEnabled With this setting each subframe is expanded to its contents.
        On touch devices, it is desired to not have any scrollable sub parts of the page
        as it results in a confusing user experience, with scrolling sometimes scrolling sub parts
        and at other times scrolling the page itself. For this reason iframes and framesets are
        barely usable on touch devices. This will flatten all the frames to become one scrollable page.
        This is disabled by default.
    \value SiteSpecificQuirksEnabled This setting enables WebKit's workaround for broken sites. It is
        enabled by default.
    \value CSSGridLayoutEnabled This setting enables support for the CSS 3 Grid Layout module. This
        CSS module is currently only a draft and support for it is disabled by default.
    \value ScrollAnimatorEnabled This setting enables animated scrolling. It is disabled by default.
    \value CaretBrowsingEnabled This setting enables caret browsing. It is disabled by default.
    \value NotificationsEnabled Specifies whether support for the HTML 5 web notifications is enabled
        or not. This is enabled by default.
