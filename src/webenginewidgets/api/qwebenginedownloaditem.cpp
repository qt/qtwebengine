    \class QWebEngineDownloadItem
    \brief The QWebEngineDownloadItem class provides information about a download.

    \since 5.5

    \inmodule QtWebEngineWidgets

    QWebEngineDownloadItem models a download throughout its life cycle, starting
    with a pending download request and finishing with a completed download. It
    can be used, for example, to get information about new downloads, to monitor
    progress, and to pause, resume, and cancel downloads.

    Downloads are usually triggered by user interaction on a web page. It is the
    QWebEngineProfile's responsibility to notify the application of new download
    requests, which it does by emitting the
    \l{QWebEngineProfile::downloadRequested}{downloadRequested} signal together
    with a newly created QWebEngineDownloadItem. The application can then
    examine this item and decide whether to accept it or not. A signal handler
    must explicitly call accept() on the item for \QWE to actually start
    downloading and writing data to disk. If no signal handler calls accept(),
    then the download request will be automatically rejected and nothing will be
    written to disk.

    \note Some properties, such as setting the path and file name where the file
    will be saved (see \l downloadDirectory() and \l downloadFileName()), can
    only be changed before calling accept().

    \section2 Object Life Cycle

    All items are guaranteed to be valid during the emission of the
    \l{QWebEngineProfile::downloadRequested}{downloadRequested} signal. If
    accept() is \e not called by any signal handler, then the item will be
    deleted \e immediately after signal emission. This means that the
    application \b{must not} keep references to rejected download items. It also
    means the application should not use a queued connection to this signal.

    If accept() \e is called by a signal handler, then the QWebEngineProfile
    will take ownership of the item. However, it is safe for the application to
    delete the item at any time, except during the handling of the
    \l{QWebEngineProfile::downloadRequested}{downloadRequested} signal. The
    QWebEngineProfile being a long-lived object, it is in fact recommended that
    the application delete any items it is no longer interested in.

    \note Deleting an item will also automatically cancel a download since 5.12.2,
    but it is recommended to cancel manually before deleting for portability.

    \section2 Web Page Downloads

    In addition to normal file downloads, which consist simply of retrieving
    some raw bytes from the network and writing them to disk, \QWE also
    supports saving complete web pages, which involves parsing the page's HTML,
    downloading any dependent resources, and potentially packaging everything
    into a special file format (\l savePageFormat). To check if a download is
    for a file or a web page, use \l isSavePageDownload.

    \value FileSecurityCheckFailed An attempt to check the safety of the download
           failed due to unexpected reasons.
    \value FileTooShort An attempt was made to seek past the end of a file when
           opening a file (as part of resuming a previously interrupted download).
    \value FileHashMismatch The partial file did not match the expected hash.

    \value NetworkFailed General network failure.
    \value NetworkTimeout The network operation has timed out.
    \value NetworkDisconnected The network connection has been terminated.
    \value NetworkServerDown The server has gone down.
    \value NetworkInvalidRequest The network request was invalid (for example, the
           original or redirected URL is invalid, has an unsupported scheme, or is disallowed by policy).

    \value ServerFailed General server failure.
    \value ServerBadContent The server does not have the requested data.
    \value ServerUnauthorized The server did not authorize access to the resource.
    \value ServerCertProblem A problem with the server certificate occurred.
    \value ServerForbidden Access forbidden by the server.
    \value ServerUnreachable Unexpected server response (might indicate that
