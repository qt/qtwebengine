    \class QWebEnginePage
    \brief The QWebEnginePage class provides an object to view and edit web documents.
    \since 5.4
    \inmodule QtWebEngineCore

    A \e {web engine page} holds the contents of an HTML document, the history of navigated
    links, and actions.

    QWebEnginePage's API is very similar to QWebEngineView, as you are still provided with
    common functions like action() (known as
    \l{QWebEngineView::pageAction()}{pageAction}() in QWebEngineView), triggerAction(),
    and findText().

    A page can be loaded using load() or setUrl(). Alternatively, if you have
    the HTML content readily available, you can use setHtml(). The GET method is
    always used to load URLs.

    The QWebEnginePage class also offers methods to retrieve both the URL currently
    loaded by the page (see url()) as well as the URL originally requested
    to be loaded (see requestedUrl()). These methods make possible the retrieval
    of the URL before and after a DNS resolution or a redirection occurs during
    the load process. The requestedUrl() also matches to the URL added to the
    page history (\l{QWebEngineHistory}) if load is successful.

    The title of an HTML page can be accessed with the title() property.
    Additionally, a page may also specify an icon, which can be accessed
    using the icon() or its URL using the iconUrl() property.
    If the title or the icon changes, the corresponding titleChanged(), iconChanged()
    and iconUrlChanged() signals will be emitted.
    The zoomFactor() property enables zooming the contents of the web page by a
    scale factor.

    The loadStarted() signal is emitted when the page begins to load, whereas the loadProgress()
    signal is emitted whenever an element of the web page completes loading, such as an embedded
    image or a script. The loadFinished() signal is emitted when the page contents
    have been loaded completely, independent of script execution or page rendering.
    Its argument, either \c true or \c false, indicates whether or not the load
    operation succeeded.

    An HTML document is loaded in a \e {main frame} within the web page. If it references
    \e {child frames} (as defined by the \c  <frame> or \c <iframe> elements), they are considered
    part of the content. Child frames are individually accessible only through JavaScript.

    Web sites define \e {security origin} for safely accessing each other's resources for
    client-side scripting or databases. An origin consist of a host name, a scheme, and a port
    number. For example, the sites \c http://www.example.com/my/page.html and
    \c http://www.example.com/my/overview.html are allowed to share the same database or access
    each other's documents when used in HTML frame sets and JavaScript. At the same time,
    \c http://www.malicious.com/evil.html is prevented from accessing the resources of
    \c http://www.example.com/, because they are of a different security origin.
    By default, local schemes like \c file:// and \c qrc:// are considered to be in the same
    security origin, and can access each other's resources. Local resources are by default
    restricted from accessing remote content, which means that \c file:// will not be able to
    access \c http://domain.com/foo.html.

    Scripts can be executed on the web page by using runJavaScript(), either in the main
    JavaScript \e world, along with the rest of the JavaScript coming from the web contents, or in
    their own isolated world. While the DOM of the page can be accessed from any world, JavaScript
    variables of a function defined in one world are not accessible from a different one.
    QWebEngineScript::ScriptWorldId provides some predefined IDs for this purpose. Using the
    \c runJavaScript() version without the world ID is the same as running the script in the
    \c MainWorld.

    The \l {QWebEngineSettings::FocusOnNavigationEnabled} {FocusOnNavigationEnabled} setting can be
    used to make the view associated with the page automatically receive focus when a navigation
    operation occurs (like loading or reloading a page or navigating through history).
*/

/*!
   \enum QWebEnginePage::FindFlag

   This enum describes the options available to the findText() function. The options
   can be OR-ed together from the following list:

   \value FindBackward Searches backwards instead of forwards.
   \value FindCaseSensitively By default findText() works case insensitive. Specifying this option
   changes the behavior to a case sensitive find operation.
*/

/*!
    \fn bool QWebEnginePage::acceptNavigationRequest(const QUrl &url, NavigationType type, bool isMainFrame)
    \since 5.5
    This function is called upon receiving a request to navigate to the specified \a url by means of
    the specified navigation type \a type. \a isMainFrame indicates whether the request corresponds
    to the main frame or a child frame. If the function returns \c true, the navigation request is
    accepted and \c url is loaded. The default implementation accepts all navigation requests.

    Navigation requests can be delegated to the Qt application instead of having the HTML handler
    engine process them by overloading this function. This is necessary when an HTML document is
    used as part of the user interface, and not to display external data, for example, when
    displaying a list of results.

    \note This function is not called for fragment navigation on the same page. Such navigation,
    for example, happens by clicking a link to a '#fragment' within the page. It does not trigger
    a load to a different document, even though it changes page's url and adds history entry.
    It only serves as a shortcut to scroll within the page. Hence, no delegation of this navigation
    type is expected to happen.

    \note The loading process is started and the loadStarted() signal is emitted
    \e before the request is accepted or rejected. Therefore, a loadFinished()
    signal that returns \c false is to be expected even after delegating the
    request.

    \note When using setHtml or setContent with relative links, make
    sure to specify a base url, otherwise the links will be considered
    invalid and no navigation requests will be emitted.

    The \l{QWebEngineUrlRequestInterceptor} class offers further options for intercepting and
    manipulating requests.

    if the user confirms the message; otherwise returns \c false.

    This function is called whenever a JavaScript program running in a frame affiliated with \a securityOrigin tries to prompt the user for input.
    The program may provide an optional message, \a msg, as well as a default value for the input in \a defaultValue.

    If the prompt was cancelled by the user, the implementation should return \c false; otherwise the
    result should be written to \a result and \c true should be returned. If the prompt was not
    cancelled by the user, the implementation should return \c true and the result string must not
    be null.

    \fn QWebEnginePage *QWebEnginePage::createWindow(WebWindowType type)
    This function is called to create a new window of the specified \a type. For example, when a

    If the new window can be created, the new window's QWebEnginePage is returned; otherwise a null pointer is returned.

    If the view associated with the web page is a QWebEngineView object, then the default implementation forwards
    the request to QWebEngineView::createWindow(); otherwise it returns a null pointer.

    If this call is not implemented or does not return a new page, \l newWindowRequested()
    is emitted to handle the request.

    \note In the cases when the window creation is being triggered by JavaScript, apart from

    \fn void QWebEnginePage::setHtml(const QString &html, const QUrl &baseUrl)
    Sets the content of this page to \a html. \a baseUrl is optional and used to resolve relative
    URLs in the document, such as referenced images or stylesheets.

    The \a html is loaded immediately; external objects are loaded asynchronously.

    If a script in the \a html runs longer than the default script timeout (currently 10 seconds),
    for example due to being blocked by a modal JavaScript alert dialog, this method will return
    as soon as possible after the timeout and any subsequent \a html will be loaded asynchronously.

    When using this method, the web engine assumes that external resources, such as JavaScript programs or style
    sheets, are encoded in UTF-8 unless otherwise specified. For example, the encoding of an external
    script can be specified through the charset attribute of the HTML script tag. It is also possible
    for the encoding to be specified by the web server.

    This is a convenience function equivalent to setContent(html, "text/html", baseUrl).

    \note This method will not affect session or global history for the page.

    \warning This function works only for HTML, for other mime types (such as XHTML and SVG)
    setContent() should be used instead.

    \warning The content will be percent encoded before being sent to the renderer via IPC.
    This may increase its size. The maximum size of the percent encoded content is
    2 megabytes minus 30 bytes.

    External objects referenced in the content are located relative to \a baseUrl.

    \fn void QWebEnginePage::runJavaScript(const QString &scriptSource, const std::function<void(const QVariant &)> &resultCallback)
    \since 5.7

    Runs the JavaScript code contained in \a scriptSource without checking
    whether the DOM of the page has been constructed. If you need more
    control over how the script is run, consider using \l scripts() instead.

    To avoid conflicts with other scripts executed on the page, the world in
    which the script is run is specified by \a worldId. The world ID values are
    the same as provided by QWebEngineScript::ScriptWorldId, and between \c 0
    and \c 256. If you leave out the \c world ID, the script is run in the
    \c MainWorld.

    When the script has been executed, \a resultCallback is called with the result of the last
    executed statement. \c resultCallback can be any of a function pointer, a functor or a lambda,
    and it is expected to take a QVariant parameter. For example:

    \code
    page.runJavaScript("document.title", [](const QVariant &v) { qDebug() << v.toString(); });
    \endcode

    Only plain data can be returned from JavaScript as the result value.
    Supported data types include all of the JSON data types as well as, for
    example, \c{Date} and \c{ArrayBuffer}. Unsupported data types include, for
    example, \c{Function} and \c{Promise}.

    \warning Do not execute lengthy routines in the callback function, because it might block the
    rendering of the web engine page.

    \warning We guarantee that the callback (\a resultCallback) is always called, but it might be done
    during page destruction. When QWebEnginePage is deleted, the callback is triggered with an invalid
    value and it is not safe to use the corresponding QWebEnginePage or QWebEngineView instance inside it.

    but will only set a granted permission for passive checks, mainly for Notification APIs that can check
    if permission has already been granted before explicitly requesting it.
