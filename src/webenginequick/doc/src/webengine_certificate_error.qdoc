    \since QtWebEngine 1.1

    \brief A utility type for ignoring certificate errors or rejecting erroneous certificates.

    This QML type contains information about a certificate error that occurred. The \l error
    property holds the reason that the error occurred and the \l description property holds a
    short localized description of the error. The \l url property holds the URL that triggered
    the error.

    The certificate can be rejected by calling \l rejectCertificate(), which will stop loading the
    web engine request. By default, an invalid certificate will be automatically rejected.

    The certificate error can be ignored by calling \l acceptCertificate(), which will
    resume loading the request.

    It is possible to defer the decision of rejecting a certificate by calling \l defer(),
    which is useful when waiting for user input.

    \sa WebEngineView::certificateError
*/
/*!
  \qmlmethod void WebEngineCertificateError::defer()

  This function should be called when there is a need to postpone the decision whether to ignore a
  certificate error, for example, while waiting for user input. When called, the function pauses the
  URL request until acceptCertificate() or rejectCertificate() is called.

/*!
  \qmlmethod void WebEngineCertificateError::acceptCertificate()

  The certificate error is ignored, and the web engine view continues to load the requested URL.
 */
/*!
  \qmlmethod void WebEngineCertificateError::rejectCertificate()

  The certificate is rejected, and the web engine view stops loading the requested URL.
